The capital of Bangladesh is Dhaka.

Bangladesh covers an area of approximately 147,570 square kilometers (56,980 square miles).

As of my last update in September 2021, the population of Bangladesh is estimated to be around 166 million people, making it one of the most densely populated countries in the world.

The official language of Bangladesh is Bengali (Bangla).

The currency used in Bangladesh is the Bangladeshi Taka (BDT).

Bangladesh offers various beautiful tourist spots, such as the Sundarbans Mangrove Forest, Cox's Bazar (the longest natural sea beach in the world), the historical city of Bagerhat, and the archaeological site of Mahasthangarh, among others.

Bangladesh experiences a tropical monsoon climate, with distinct wet and dry seasons. The monsoon season lasts from June to October, bringing heavy rainfall to the country.

Bangladesh's economy relies heavily on the textile and garment industry, which is a significant source of employment and export revenue. Other industries include agriculture (especially rice cultivation), fisheries, and the information technology sector.

Popular traditional dishes in Bangladesh include biryani, rice and fish curry, panta bhat (fermented rice), hilsa fish, and various types of sweets like roshogolla and sandesh.

Bangladesh celebrates several cultural festivals, such as the Bengali New Year (Pohela Boishakh), Durga Puja, Eid al-Fitr, and Victory Day, which marks the country's liberation from Pakistan in 1971.
